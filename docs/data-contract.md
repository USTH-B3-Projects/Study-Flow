## 7. Derived Task Values

The following values are calculated by relevant smart feature services and are not stored.

| Field | Type | Stored? | Description |
|---|---|---:|---|
| urgencyScore | Number | No | Calculated from deadline |
| importanceScore | Number | No | Converted from importance level |
| remainingWorkload | Number | No | Remaining estimated work |
| workloadScore | Number | No | Calculated from remaining workload |
| priorityScore | Number | No | Final priority score |
| taskStatus | TaskStatus | No | derived task status |
| hasWorkloadWarning | Boolean | No | Whether the task is at risk |

**remainingWorkload:**
<br>
If estimatedDuration is provided:
    remainingWorkload =
        estimatedDuration × (1 - currentProgress / 100)

Otherwise:
    remainingWorkload =
        2 × (1 - currentProgress / 100)

**priorityScore:**
<br>
priorityScore = 0.5 × urgencyScore + 0.3 × importanceScore + 0.2 × workloadScore

**taskStatus:**
<br>
if currentProgress == 100
    status = completed

else if deadline has passed
    status = overdue

else
    status = pending

**workloadWarning:**
<br>
If status == completed
    no warning

Else if status == overdue
    show overdue

Else if
    (urgencyScore >= 80 AND workloadScore >= 60)
    OR
    (urgencyScore >= 60 AND workloadScore >= 80)
    show workload warning

Else
    no warning

## 8. WarningNotification (no stored data)

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| taskName | String | Name of risky task |
| deadline | ISO Date String | Task deadline |
| remainingWorkload | Number | Remaining estimated hours |
| message | String | Warning shown to student |

## 9. StudyScheduleItem (no stored data)

## 10. Relationships

- One Student can have zero or many Courses.
- One Course belongs to exactly one Student, identified by username.
- One Course can have zero or many Tasks.
- One Task belongs to exactly one Course, identified by courseId.

## 11. Deletion Rules

### Delete Course

Before deleting a course, the system must display a confirmation.

If confirmed, the course and all tasks belonging to that course
are deleted.

### Delete Task

Before deleting a task, the system must display a confirmation.

## 12. Local Storage

| Key | Value Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| studyflow_users | Array<Student> | Registered students |
| studyflow_courses | Array<Course> | All courses |
| studyflow_tasks | Array<Task> | All tasks |
| studyflow_current_user | String or null | username of logged-in student |

## 13. Recommended Task View

`smartService.js` combines stored Task data with calculated values.

### Recommendation Sorting

`PriorityService` combines stored Task data with calculated priority values.

All non-completed tasks are included in recommendation ranking.
Completed tasks are excluded.

Tasks are sorted by:

1. priorityScore DESC
2. deadline ASC
3. importanceScore DESC
4. createdAt ASC
